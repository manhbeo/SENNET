- Here is my implementation for the SenNet + HOA - Hacking the Human Vasculature in 3D competition on Kaggle.                                      
- The dataset consist of more than 40GB of TIFF 3D scans from several kidney datasets. The competition it's about segmentation of the blood vessel in that TIFF scan.                        
- I choose to use an U-net to do the segmentation task, and then convert the segmentation output image into run length encoded mask.                                 

Because of the policy of the competition, I cannot public the data in this repository. Here is the link to the competition: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/blood-vessel-segmentation
